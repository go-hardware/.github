[`ghw`](https://github.com/go-hardware/ghw) is a Go library providing hardware
inspection and discovery for Linux and Windows. There is partial support for
MacOSX.

`ghw` gathers information about your hardware's **capacity**, **capabilities**,
and **resource usage**.

## History

`go-hardware/ghw` began life as [`jaypipes/ghw`][jaypipes-ghw]. All
functionality from `jaypipes/ghw` was ported over to `go-hardware/ghw` by Jay
Pipes in an effort to bring `ghw` into a non-personal Github organization and
increase the number of contributors to `ghw`.

If you're a `jaypipes/ghw` user, read the
[documentation on changes](https://github.com/go-hardware/ghw#coming-from-githubcomjaypipesghw) between the
old and new `ghw`.
